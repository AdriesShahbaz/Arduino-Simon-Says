# Arduino-Simon-Says
Recreating a game of simon says using an arduino

This game was created to challenge the users memory. In simplest terms, the game will begin with one of the 4 LEDs flashing (random). The user then has to replicate this random pattern with the buttons that are lined up respectively to their LED. If the user is successful, a new LED will be added to the pattern and the user will get 1 added to their score. If the user gets a score of 100 (very very unlikely!) then the game will end and the user will win. If the user ever messes up the pattern then all 4 LEDs will flash 5 times and the game will proceed to start from the beginning with only 1 LED flashing.

Components:
- 4 Push Buttons
- 1 Red LED
- 1 Green LED
- 1 Yellow LED
- 1 Blue LED
- 4 220Ω resistors
- 1 Arduino Uno 3
- 4 10KΩ resistors


Real Life Applications: Able to challange a users memory in a fun and interactive way

Design:
- 4 different coloured LED's (Red, Green, Yellow, Blue)
- 4 Pushbuttons, in the order of the LED's respectivly
- (If I had extra time) make a shield for the buttons and designed a PCB where each LED's pushbutton were to be right below its respective LED

Since video files are too large, I am linking my video demonstration to a seperate website. The link can be found below:
